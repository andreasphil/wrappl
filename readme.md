# Wrappl

This is a ridiculously simple wrapper page for the popular time tracking tool [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com). It lets you add a shortcut to Toggl's web app to your iPad's home screen and launches it in full screen mode without the Safari chrome.

## Usage

Open the Wrappl website at <https://anphil.github.io/wrappl> on your device. Head over to Safari's share menu, select <i>Add to Home Screen</i> and you're ready to go. The application should detect  whether it is running in full-screen mode and redirect you automatically. If that fails for some reason, there's still a button to get you there safely ðŸ™‚.
